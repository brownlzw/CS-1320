				   <div class="title">CS 1270 Database Management System</div>
				   <p>The amount of information that must be processed in many applications is exploding. A modern database managementn system (DBMS) provides the scalability that is required by these applications. As a result, DBMS’s are now ubiquitous in modern industrial practice. This course examines the practice of database management through two major units. The first discusses the users view (externals) of a DBMS. It covers concepts that are fundamental to the proper use of a DBMS including database languages and database design. The second discusses what goes on inside (internals) a DBMS. It covers algorithmic detail for some of the key components of a DBMS.</p>

				   <div class="title">ENGN 2912B Scientific Programming in C++</div>
				   <p>The primary aim of this course is to gain practical experience with programming in the C++ language. In particular, students will solve numerical and scientific computing problems using modern C++ and commonly used scientific computing and visualization libraries. Students will become proficient with the use of common programming toolsets for compiling, linking, debugging, and managing source code in a collaborative software development environment. Final projects may utilize Brown University’s Center for Computation and Visualization (CCV) to explore more advanced scientific computing topics, such as parallel computing with multi-threaded applications, machine learning with convolutional neural networks (CNN), 3D visualization of large data sets, or algorithm acceleration with graphical processing units (GPU).</p>
