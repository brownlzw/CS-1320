Remember the early 2000s when chatting with buddies on AIM was all the rage? Now, communicating with people over any website is almost always a given. This project realizes virtual communication and RESTful web services by building a basic chatroom.

My works mainly include:
• Built a server and managed routes using Node.js and Express.js, and parsed post requests data from client side  using body-parser package
• Implemented a templating engine to process some HTMLs written by Mustache, a templating language, and adapt the templating engines so that they work directly with Express via the consolidate library and Hogan, Twitter's node implementation of Mustache
• Created and maintained a database that stores information of messages( room, nickname, message, time etc.) through any-db module with SQLite3, and updated the content of web pages by SQL queries
